# Knowledge Graph Schema

This directory contains schemas related to the knowledge graph.

This could include:
- JSON Schemas for validating data entities if stored as documents.
- Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts for graph databases (e.g., Cypher for Neo4j, Gremlin).
- Ontologies or controlled vocabularies (e.g., RDF/OWL definitions).

For now, we will start with conceptual JSON schemas based on the core types.
