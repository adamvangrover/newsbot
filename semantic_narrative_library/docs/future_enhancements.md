# Future Enhancements for Semantic Narrative Library

This document outlines potential future enhancements and directions for the Semantic Narrative Library. These are not part of the current scope but represent areas for growth.

## 1. Federated Learning (FL)

**Concept:**
Implement Federated Learning capabilities to allow users or different instances of the library to collaboratively train and improve models (e.g., for driver scoring, narrative customization, semantic link prediction) without sharing their raw, potentially private data.

**Potential Use Cases:**
-   **Privacy-Preserving Model Improvement:** Analysts or institutions could contribute to a global model's understanding of driver impacts or narrative styles based on their local, private datasets.
-   **Personalization:** User-specific models could be fine-tuned using FL principles, adapting to individual preferences or proprietary knowledge.
-   **Learning from Diverse Data:** Aggregate insights from varied, distributed datasets that cannot be centrally pooled.

**Considerations:**
-   Significant increase in architectural and operational complexity.
-   Requires careful design of data schemas and model update protocols.
-   Frameworks like TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, or Flower could be explored.
-   A clear value proposition over centralized or isolated models would be needed.

**Status:** Placeholder for future consideration. No active development in the initial version.

## 2. Advanced Reasoning Engine

-   Implement more sophisticated graph traversal algorithms.
-   Incorporate probabilistic reasoning or Bayesian networks.
-   Allow for multi-hop reasoning to uncover indirect relationships and drivers.
-   Develop a more formal rule engine for defining how drivers interact.

## 3. Persistent Knowledge Graph Storage

-   Integrate with a dedicated graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB) or a relational database with graph querying capabilities.
-   This would replace the current in-memory loading from a JSON file, enabling scalability and more complex querying.
-   Develop data migration and schema management tools for the database.

## 4. Real LLM Integration and Advanced LLMOps

-   Replace the `SimulatedNarrativeGenerator` with actual API calls to various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or locally hosted models.
-   Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and asynchronous processing for LLM calls.
-   Develop a more comprehensive LLMOps pipeline:
    -   Prompt versioning, A/B testing, and management platforms.
    -   Monitoring for LLM performance, cost, and output quality (e.g., toxicity, relevance).
    -   Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific data for improved narrative quality and factual accuracy.
    -   Implementing guardrails and validation layers for LLM outputs.

## 5. Enhanced Frontend User Interface

-   Develop interactive visualizations for the knowledge graph.
-   Create user-friendly forms and interfaces for querying and inputting data.
-   Implement user authentication and personalized dashboards.
-   Improve state management and UI performance for larger datasets.

## 6. Data Ingestion from Diverse Sources

-   Develop connectors and parsers for ingesting data from various sources:
    -   Financial APIs (e.g., stock prices, economic indicators).
    -   News feeds and articles (requiring NLP for entity and event extraction).
    -   User-uploaded documents or spreadsheets.
-   Implement a data validation and cleaning pipeline.

## 7. Configuration Management

-   Introduce a more robust configuration system (e.g., using dedicated config files or environment variable management) for aspects like data paths, API keys, model endpoints, etc.

## 8. Asynchronous Operations and Scalability

-   Refactor backend operations (especially reasoning and LLM calls) to be fully asynchronous for better performance under load.
-   Design the system for horizontal scalability if deployed in a distributed environment.

## 9. More Comprehensive Testing

-   Expand unit test coverage.
-   Implement integration tests for interactions between components (e.g., API and Reasoner).
-   Develop end-to-end tests for key user flows.
-   Incorporate performance and load testing.

These are ideas for how the library could evolve. The current version provides a foundational set of features.
