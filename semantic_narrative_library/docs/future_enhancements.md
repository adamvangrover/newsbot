# Future Enhancements for Semantic Narrative Library

This document outlines potential future enhancements and directions for the Semantic Narrative Library. These are not part of the current scope but represent areas for growth.

## 1. Federated Learning (FL)

**Concept:**
Implement Federated Learning capabilities to allow users or different instances of the library to collaboratively train and improve models (e.g., for driver scoring, narrative customization, semantic link prediction) without sharing their raw, potentially private data.

**Potential Use Cases:**
-   **Privacy-Preserving Model Improvement:** Analysts or institutions could contribute to a global model's understanding of driver impacts or narrative styles based on their local, private datasets.
-   **Personalization:** User-specific models could be fine-tuned using FL principles, adapting to individual preferences or proprietary knowledge.
-   **Learning from Diverse Data:** Aggregate insights from varied, distributed datasets that cannot be centrally pooled.

**Considerations:**
-   Significant increase in architectural and operational complexity.
-   Requires careful design of data schemas and model update protocols.
-   Frameworks like TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, or Flower could be explored.
-   A clear value proposition over centralized or isolated models would be needed.

**Status:** Placeholder for future consideration. No active development in the initial version.

## 2. Knowledge Graph Evolution and Continuous Learning

**Concept:**
Transform the knowledge graph (KG) from a static dataset (loaded at startup) into a dynamic, evolving system that learns and adapts over time. This involves mechanisms for updating the KG with new information, refining existing data based on feedback or new evidence, and potentially adjusting the confidence or parameters of rules and relationships.

**Mechanisms for Evolution:**

*   **Continuous Data Ingestion:** Regularly ingest new data (news, financial reports, market signals, regulatory changes) via the `DataIngestor` service. New entities and relationships would be added to the KG.
*   **NLP-Driven Updates:** Use the `NLProcessor` to extract entities, relationships, and sentiment from new unstructured data. These extracted elements can then be proposed as additions or modifications to the KG, possibly with a human-in-the-loop validation step.
*   **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Allow users to validate, correct, or annotate information presented by the system (e.g., confirm an identified impact, correct an entity linkage, rate the relevance of a narrative).
    *   This feedback could be used to:
        *   Adjust the `strength` or `confidence` of specific `Relationship` instances.
        *   Update the `impact_potential` of `Driver` entities.
        *   Refine the `probability` or `magnitude` in impact `Rule` definitions.
        *   Provide data for fine-tuning underlying models (e.g., sentiment analysis, significance scoring).
*   **Validated Impact Tracking (Learning from Outcomes):**
    *   If the system predicts potential impacts (e.g., via `ImpactAnalyzer`), and later, actual outcomes are observed (e.g., a company's stock price *did* fall after a predicted risk materialized), this information can be fed back.
    *   This "ground truth" can be used to:
        *   Validate or update the rules in the `RuleTemplate`s that led to the prediction.
        *   Adjust probabilities and magnitudes associated with specific impact types or driver-entity interactions.
        *   Serve as training data for machine learning models that might underpin the `SignificanceScorer` or `ImpactAnalyzer`.
*   **"Post-Training Fine-Tuning Library" / Adaptive Rules:**
    *   This refers to the idea that the rules (e.g., in `rule_template_example.json`) are not static.
    *   The system could maintain a library of rules where parameters (probabilities, magnitudes, conditions) are adaptable.
    *   As new evidence or feedback comes in, these parameters could be fine-tuned, effectively allowing the system's "understanding" of causal relationships to evolve.
    *   This could involve statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian updating for probabilities) or retraining lightweight models that govern rule application.
*   **Anomaly Detection and KG Refinement:** Periodically scan the KG for inconsistencies, outdated information, or anomalies that might indicate errors or areas needing updates.

**Technical Considerations for a Learning KG:**
*   **Versioning:** Versioning the KG or changes to it would be crucial for traceability and rollback.
*   **Provenance:** Tracking the source and confidence of all data and relationships in the KG.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Mechanisms to handle conflicting information from different sources or user feedback.
*   **Scalability:** A learning KG that grows continuously requires a scalable backend database and efficient update mechanisms.
*   **Human Oversight:** For critical updates or learning from ambiguous feedback, a human-in-the-loop process is likely necessary to maintain quality and prevent model drift or erroneous "learning."

**Status:** This is a highly advanced area. The current library uses a static, pre-loaded KG. Implementing a truly evolving and learning KG is a significant long-term research and development effort.

## 3. Advanced Reasoning Engine

-   Implement more sophisticated graph traversal algorithms.
-   Incorporate probabilistic reasoning or Bayesian networks.
-   Allow for multi-hop reasoning to uncover indirect relationships and drivers.
-   Develop a more formal rule engine for defining how drivers interact.

## 3. Persistent Knowledge Graph Storage

-   Integrate with a dedicated graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB) or a relational database with graph querying capabilities.
-   This would replace the current in-memory loading from a JSON file, enabling scalability and more complex querying.
-   Develop data migration and schema management tools for the database.

## 4. Real LLM Integration and Advanced LLMOps

-   Replace the `SimulatedNarrativeGenerator` with actual API calls to various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or locally hosted models.
-   Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and asynchronous processing for LLM calls.
-   Develop a more comprehensive LLMOps pipeline:
    -   Prompt versioning, A/B testing, and management platforms.
    -   Monitoring for LLM performance, cost, and output quality (e.g., toxicity, relevance).
    -   Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific data for improved narrative quality and factual accuracy.
    -   Implementing guardrails and validation layers for LLM outputs.

## 5. Enhanced Frontend User Interface

-   Develop interactive visualizations for the knowledge graph.
-   Create user-friendly forms and interfaces for querying and inputting data.
-   Implement user authentication and personalized dashboards.
-   Improve state management and UI performance for larger datasets.

## 6. Data Ingestion from Diverse Sources

-   Develop connectors and parsers for ingesting data from various sources:
    -   Financial APIs (e.g., stock prices, economic indicators).
    -   News feeds and articles (requiring NLP for entity and event extraction).
    -   User-uploaded documents or spreadsheets.
-   Implement a data validation and cleaning pipeline.

## 7. Configuration Management

-   Introduce a more robust configuration system (e.g., using dedicated config files or environment variable management) for aspects like data paths, API keys, model endpoints, etc.

## 8. Asynchronous Operations and Scalability

-   Refactor backend operations (especially reasoning and LLM calls) to be fully asynchronous for better performance under load.
-   Design the system for horizontal scalability if deployed in a distributed environment.

## 9. More Comprehensive Testing

-   Expand unit test coverage.
-   Implement integration tests for interactions between components (e.g., API and Reasoner).
-   Develop end-to-end tests for key user flows.
-   Incorporate performance and load testing.

These are ideas for how the library could evolve. The current version provides a foundational set of features.
