# Processing Pipeline Components

This directory contains placeholder Python modules for various processing components that would form an advanced analytical pipeline within the Semantic Narrative Library. These components are designed to be called by a workflow engine (see `../workflows/README.md`) or used individually.

## Overview

The goal of these components is to enable a more automated and sophisticated analysis of data, from ingestion and NLP processing to significance scoring, impact analysis, and scenario modeling.

## Placeholder Components:

1.  **`ingestion_service.py` (Class `DataIngestor`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Responsible for fetching and normalizing data from various external and internal sources.
    *   **Placeholder Methods**: `ingest_news_feed(url)`, `ingest_financial_data(api_source)`, `ingest_structured_file(file_path, format)`.
    *   **Future Implementation**: Would involve actual API clients, web scrapers (respecting `robots.txt`), parsers for different file formats, and data validation/cleaning routines. Output would likely be instances of the core Pydantic models (e.g., `NewsItem`, `FinancialReportItem`).

2.  **`nlp_service.py` (Class `NLProcessor`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Handles Natural Language Processing tasks on textual data.
    *   **Placeholder Methods**: `extract_entities(text)`, `extract_relationships(text)`, `calculate_sentiment(text)`, `summarize_text(text)`, `enhance_news_item_nlp(news_item_object)`.
    *   **Future Implementation**: Would integrate with NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, or cloud-based NLP services. This is crucial for processing unstructured data like news articles.

3.  **`significance_engine.py` (Class `SignificanceScorer`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To evaluate the importance or relevance of an event, news item, or data point within a given context (e.g., for a specific company, industry, or portfolio).
    *   **Placeholder Methods**: `score_event_significance(event_data, context_entities, ruleset)`.
    *   **Future Implementation**: Could use heuristic rules, machine learning models, or a combination. It might consider factors like event magnitude, source reliability, affected entities' profiles, and historical precedents.

4.  **`impact_analysis_engine.py` (Class `ImpactAnalyzer`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To trace and predict the potential first, second, and third-order impacts of an event or driver across the knowledge graph.
    *   **Placeholder Methods**: `trace_impacts(initial_event_id, depth_levels, knowledge_graph, ruleset_id)`.
    *   **Future Implementation**: This is a core analytical component. It would likely use the rule templates (see `../workflows/rule_template_example.json`) to determine how impacts propagate. It might involve graph traversal algorithms, probabilistic modeling, and consideration of impact magnitudes and timescales.

5.  **`scenario_engine.py` (Class `ScenarioModeler`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To simulate "what-if" scenarios by applying hypothetical events or changes to a baseline knowledge graph and observing potential outcomes.
    *   **Placeholder Methods**: `run_what_if_scenario(base_kg_data, scenario_definition_rules, target_metrics)`.
    *   **Future Implementation**: Would involve creating temporary modifications to the knowledge graph based on a scenario definition (e.g., "What if interest rates increase by 2%?" or "What if Company X acquires Company Y?"). It would then use the `ImpactAnalyzer` and other components to project outcomes.

## Current Status

-   All modules in this directory currently contain **placeholder classes and methods**.
-   They demonstrate the intended structure and interfaces but **do not contain functional logic**.
-   Full implementation of these components, especially NLP, impact analysis, and scenario modeling, requires significant effort and specialized libraries/algorithms.

These components represent the building blocks for more advanced analytical workflows envisioned for the library.
