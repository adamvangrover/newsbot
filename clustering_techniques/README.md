# Clustering Techniques

This directory contains various clustering algorithms that can be used to group similar news articles, social media posts, and other data sources.

## Adding New Algorithms

To add a new clustering algorithm, create a new Python file in this directory that implements the algorithm. The file should have a function that takes a list of data points as input and returns a list of cluster labels.
