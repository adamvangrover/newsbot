# Agent Instructions

This directory contains clustering algorithms. When adding a new algorithm, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Create a new Python file for each algorithm.** The file should be named after the algorithm (e.g., `dbscan.py`).
2.  **Implement the algorithm as a function.** The function should take a list of data points as input and return a list of cluster labels.
3.  **Add a docstring to the function.** The docstring should explain how the algorithm works and what the input and output are.
4.  **Add a `README.md` file to the directory.** The `README.md` file should explain how to use the new algorithm.
