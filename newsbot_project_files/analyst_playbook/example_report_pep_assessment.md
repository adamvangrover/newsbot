# CONFIDENTIAL: Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Risk Assessment

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Replace with [Report Date] in actual use)
**Subject Company:** GlobalTransact Ltd.
**Associated Person:** Mr. Alistair Finch
**Analyst:** Regulatory Compliance & Risk Unit (Conceptual)
**Report Type:** PEP Risk Assessment & Enhanced Due Diligence Recommendation

## 1. Executive Summary

This report assesses the potential risks associated with GlobalTransact Ltd.'s engagement of Mr. Alistair Finch, who qualifies as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) due to his former senior role as Special Trade Envoy for the Republic of Veridia. The primary risks identified include potential exposure to corruption, bribery, sanctions violations (should Veridia's status change), significant reputational damage, and the exertion of undue influence. Given Mr. Finch's profile and Veridia's high perceived corruption levels, this engagement is classified as high-risk. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is immediately warranted, and robust mitigation strategies, including contract review and ongoing monitoring, must be implemented if the relationship is to proceed. This report highlights key findings for senior management review and critical decision-making regarding the risk appetite and necessary safeguards.

## 2. Subject Profiles

*   **GlobalTransact Ltd. ("The Company"):** A privately held international logistics and trade facilitation company, headquartered in London, UK. The Company specializes in complex cross-border shipments, customs brokerage, and supply chain solutions, with significant operational interests in emerging markets, including an expanding footprint in the Caspian Region where Veridia is a key target market.
*   **Mr. Alistair Finch ("The PEP"):**
    *   **Former Position:** Special Trade Envoy, Ministry of Commerce and Foreign Investment, Republic of Veridia (Official Term: 2018-2022). Directly reported to the Minister.
    *   **Current Status:** Operates as an independent consultant and strategic advisor through his registered firm "Finch Global Strategies Ltd." (registered in [e.g., Cyprus]).
    *   **Notoriety & Context:** Mr. Finch was a prominent figure in Veridia's efforts to attract foreign investment and was a lead negotiator for several bilateral trade agreements. During and after his tenure, independent media outlets and anti-corruption NGOs raised concerns regarding opaque tender processes for infrastructure projects he oversaw. While no formal charges were brought against Mr. Finch personally, two junior officials in his department were later investigated for irregularities related to contract awards during his term. Veridia is currently rated 135/180 on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, indicating systemic corruption challenges.

## 3. Nature of Association

*   **Engagement:** GlobalTransact Ltd. has entered into an advisory services agreement with Finch Global Strategies Ltd., effective September 1, 2023, for an initial term of 12 months with an option to renew.
*   **Stated Purpose of Advisory:** To provide "strategic counsel and facilitation services for market entry, navigating complex regulatory frameworks, and identifying key local partners" within Veridia and two neighboring countries.
*   **Source of Information:** Internal business development proposal (Project ID: CASPIAN_EXP_2023), due diligence initiation request from the regional BD head, and a public announcement by Finch Global Strategies Ltd. on their new client engagements.

## 4. Potential Risks Associated with Mr. Alistair Finch

The association with Mr. Finch, given his PEP status, the operational context of Veridia, and past allegations (even if unproven against him directly), presents substantial risks:

*   **Corruption & Bribery Risk (High):**
    *   High likelihood that Mr. Finch retains significant influence or close personal relationships with current Veridian government officials, customs authorities, and licensing bodies.
    *   Significant risk that advisory fees or "facilitation payments" could be directly or indirectly used as bribes to Veridian officials to secure licenses, expedite customs clearance, win tenders, or otherwise gain preferential treatment for GlobalTransact Ltd.
*   **Sanctions Risk (Medium - Dynamic):**
    *   Currently, Veridia is not under comprehensive international sanctions. However, certain Veridian state-owned enterprises in sectors GlobalTransact might engage with have been flagged by OFAC for "potential future designation" due to regional instability. Mr. Finch's known past dealings with these SOEs could draw GlobalTransact into complex sanctions exposure if the situation evolves.
*   **Reputational Risk (High):**
    *   Association with a PEP from a country known for high corruption, particularly one whose department faced scandal, can severely damage GlobalTransact Ltd.'s reputation with international partners, financial institutions, and ethical investors.
    *   Any new adverse media or official scrutiny regarding Mr. Finch or Veridian corruption could immediately tarnish GlobalTransact Ltd. by association.
*   **Undue Influence / Unfair Advantage (High):**
    *   Risk that Mr. Finch might leverage non-public information or inappropriate influence to secure advantages for GlobalTransact Ltd., potentially violating fair competition laws or local/international anti-corruption statutes (e.g., UK Bribery Act, FCPA if US nexus exists).
*   **Operational & Financial Risk (Medium-High):**
    *   Contracts or licenses obtained via questionable means are vulnerable to cancellation, review, or legal challenge, especially with governmental changes in Veridia.
    *   Banks and financial partners are likely to impose stricter scrutiny (EDD) on GlobalTransact Ltd.'s transactions related to Veridia, potentially causing delays, increased compliance costs, or even de-risking by correspondent banks.
    *   The "success fees" mentioned in the initial proposal are a major red flag for potential bribery.

## 5. Summary of (Hypothetical) Initial Due Diligence Findings

*(This section simulates findings from basic due diligence that would trigger this PEP assessment.)*

*   **PEP Screening:** Mr. Alistair Finch flagged as a high-risk PEP in multiple commercial databases due to his former senior government role in Veridia.
*   **Adverse Media (Finch & Veridia):** Multiple articles from 2021-2023 detail corruption allegations within Veridia's Ministry of Commerce during Finch's oversight period, focusing on specific infrastructure tenders. Finch not named as a target of investigation but mentioned as head of the relevant division.
*   **Contract Draft (GlobalTransact & Finch Global Strategies):** The draft services agreement includes a substantial monthly retainer and vaguely defined "success fees" contingent upon "successful market establishment" and "securing initial operational permits." The payment structure and lack of specific, legitimate deliverables for success fees are highly problematic.
*   **Internal Controls Gap (GlobalTransact):** While GlobalTransact Ltd. has a general ABC policy, procedures for PEP identification, risk assessment, and specific approval for engaging high-risk third parties like PEPs appear underdeveloped or not consistently followed by the regional business development unit.

## 6. Information for Escalation to Senior Management

*   **Confirmed PEP Status:** Mr. Alistair Finch is unequivocally a high-risk PEP.
*   **Overall Inherent Risk:** This engagement is assessed as **CRITICALLY HIGH** without immediate and comprehensive mitigation.
*   **Key Concerns for Immediate Escalation:**
    1.  The severe corruption and bribery risks associated with Mr. Finch's profile and Veridia's environment.
    2.  The problematic "success fee" structure in the proposed contract, which is a classic bribery red flag.
    3.  The potential for severe reputational damage and legal/regulatory consequences (UK Bribery Act, etc.).
    4.  Apparent gaps in internal due diligence and approval processes prior to this assessment.
*   **Business Rationale vs. Unmitigated Risk:** The strategic desire to enter the Veridian market must be urgently re-evaluated against the current unacceptably high level of risk presented by this specific engagement.

## 7. Recommended Actions & Mitigation Strategies (Urgent)

1.  **Immediate Suspension of Engagement:** Halt any further payments or substantive work with Finch Global Strategies Ltd. pending completion of full EDD and risk mitigation plan approval by the Board or a designated sub-committee.
2.  **Comprehensive Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):**
    *   Engage external specialists (forensic accounting / corporate investigations) to conduct in-depth EDD on Mr. Finch, Finch Global Strategies Ltd., and any identified close associates or sub-consultants he may use in Veridia. This must include source of wealth, detailed political connections, and any links to prior corruption cases.
    *   Thoroughly vet the legitimacy of all proposed services and deliverables.
3.  **Contract Renegotiation/Termination:**
    *   The current contract draft, especially regarding "success fees," is unacceptable. If the engagement is to proceed, the contract must be renegotiated to feature transparent, fixed fees based on clearly defined, legitimate deliverables, with all payments subject to rigorous compliance pre-approval.
    *   A clear termination clause for compliance breaches or unacceptable risk escalation must be included.
4.  **Mandatory Compliance Approval:** Any decision to proceed with this engagement (post-EDD and contract revision) must be documented and approved at the highest level (e.g., Board Risk Committee, CEO & Chief Compliance Officer jointly), explicitly acknowledging the residual risks.
5.  **Strengthen Internal ABC & PEP Controls:**
    *   Conduct an immediate review and enhancement of GlobalTransact Ltd.'s policies and procedures for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with PEPs and other high-risk third parties.
    *   Mandatory training for all relevant staff (BD, legal, finance, procurement) on these enhanced controls.
6.  **Implement Stringent Ongoing Monitoring:** If engagement proceeds, implement continuous monitoring of Mr. Finch, his firm, related transactions, and the political/regulatory environment in Veridia. Regular re-assessment of the risk profile is mandatory.
