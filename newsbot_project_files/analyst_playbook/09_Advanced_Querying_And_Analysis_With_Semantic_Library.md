# 09. Advanced Querying & Analysis with the Semantic Narrative Library (Conceptual Guide)

## 1. Introduction

The previous guides in this playbook focus on established analytical techniques and readily available tools. This guide takes a forward-looking, *conceptual* perspective. It explores how an analyst might leverage the future, more advanced capabilities of the **Semantic Narrative Library (SNL)**—as designed in the "Advanced Framework" plan within this repository—to achieve a more powerful, efficient, and insightful analytical workflow.

The SNL, in its advanced form, is envisioned as an intelligent system that combines a dynamic knowledge graph (KG) with sophisticated processing engines for NLP, significance scoring, impact analysis, and scenario modeling, all orchestrated by a flexible workflow engine.

**Objective**: To illustrate how analysts could interact with a mature SNL to perform complex queries, automate analyses, and gain deeper, causally-linked insights from diverse information sources. This guide will refer to the conceptual components and data models designed for the SNL's advanced framework.

## 2. Conceptual Interaction with an Advanced Knowledge Graph (KG)

In its advanced state, the SNL's KG would be continuously updated with new information from various sources (news, financial reports, market signals, regulatory changes, etc.), all structured according to the extended Pydantic models (e.g., `NewsItem`, `PoliticalEvent`, `FinancialReportItem`, `Security`).

### 2.1. Querying Extended Entity Types and Relationships

An analyst could perform complex queries beyond simple entity lookups. Imagine a future UI, advanced CLI, or even a natural language query interface built on top of the SNL's API.

*   **Examples of Advanced Queries (Conceptual)**, leveraging the extended Pydantic models:
    *   *"Show all `NewsItem` entities (with attributes like `source_name`, `sentiment_score`) with a sentiment score below -0.7 related to 'comp_alpha' or its key competitors in the last 7 days."*
    *   *"List all `PoliticalEvent` entities (with attributes like `event_subtype`, `location`) of type 'TradeDispute' in 'RegionX' that have a `RegulatoryChange` entity as a direct consequence within the last quarter."*
    *   *"Identify `FinancialReportItem` entities for companies in 'ind_retail' where specific `key_metrics` (e.g., 'RevenueGrowth') < 0% and other metrics (e.g., 'InventoryLevels') increased by >10% sequentially."*
    *   *"What `MarketSignal` entities (with attributes like `signal_type`, `asset_class`) have occurred for `Security` entities (linked to `issuer_id`) in 'comp_beta's peer group following the recent `MacroIndicator` release for 'inflation_cpi'?"*
    *   *"Find all `Relationships` of type 'supply_chain_dependency' between `Company` entities in 'ind_auto' and suppliers (also `Company` entities) located in 'RegionY' which is currently experiencing `PoliticalEvent` type 'PortStrike'."*

These queries would leverage the rich attributes of the extended entity models (like `NewsItem.sentiment_score`, `PoliticalEvent.event_subtype`, `FinancialReportItem.key_metrics`, `MarketSignal.signal_type`, `Security.issuer_id`) and the relationships connecting them within the KG.

## 3. Utilizing the Conceptual Workflow Engine

The SNL's advanced framework includes a design for a workflow engine that can orchestrate sequences of analytical tasks using predefined templates (see `semantic_narrative_library/workflows/workflow_template_example.json`).

### 3.1. Triggering and Monitoring Workflows

*   **Initiation**: An analyst might trigger a workflow in several ways:
    *   Manually via a future UI (e.g., selecting "Analyze News Impact" and providing a `NewsItem` ID and `Company` ID).
    *   Automatically, based on new data ingestion (e.g., a high-significance `NewsItem` about a portfolio company automatically triggers an impact analysis workflow).
    *   Via an advanced CLI command (like the placeholder `snl-cli analyze-news ...`).
*   **Example Workflow: "News Impact Analysis on Company"**
    *   **Input**: `news_item_id`, `target_company_id`.
    *   **Conceptual Steps (as per `workflow_template_example.json`)**:
        1.  `Fetch News Item Details`: Retrieve the `NewsItem` from the KG.
        2.  `NLP Processing`: (If needed) `NLProcessor` enhances the news text (sentiment, entities).
        3.  `Score News Significance`: `SignificanceScorer` evaluates the news's importance for the target company.
        4.  `Analyze Potential Impacts`: `ImpactAnalyzer` uses rules (from a `RuleTemplate`) to trace first, second, and third-order impacts on the target company and related entities.
        5.  `Generate Impact Narrative`: The `NarrativeGenerator` (ideally a real LLM) synthesizes findings into a human-readable report.
*   **Interpreting Workflow Outputs**: The analyst would receive a structured output, including:
    *   The significance score and its justification.
    *   A list of potential impact chains, detailing the type of impact, affected entities, order of impact, probability, and magnitude (as designed in `semantic_narrative_library/processing/impact_analysis_engine.py`).
    *   A comprehensive narrative explaining these findings.

## 4. Leveraging Conceptual Rule-Based Impact Analysis

The `ImpactAnalyzer` component is envisioned to use a `RuleTemplate` (see `semantic_narrative_library/workflows/rule_template_example.json`) to determine how events propagate.

*   **Understanding Impact Chains**: Analysts would examine the output from the `ImpactAnalyzer`, which could look like:
    *   `Event: 'Major Chip Factory Fire in RegionZ' (NewsItem)`
        *   `1st Order Impact`: `Target: 'Global Semiconductor Supply' (Industry Attribute), Type: 'SupplyConstraint', Prob: 0.9, Mag: High`
            *   `2nd Order Impact`: `Target: 'comp_alpha' (Company, uses these chips), Type: 'ProductionDelayRisk', Prob: 0.7, Mag: Medium`
                *   `3rd Order Impact`: `Target: 'comp_alpha_stock_outlook' (Derived Metric), Type: 'NegativeRevision', Prob: 0.6, Mag: Medium`
    *   The 'Why'**: Each step in the impact chain would ideally be linked to the rule(s) that triggered it (from a `RuleTemplate`) and include an `explanation_template` from the rule, providing transparency into the reasoning.
*   **Probabilities & Magnitudes**: These values, output by the conceptual `ImpactAnalyzer` (based on rules and potentially learned models), would help analysts prioritize focus on the most likely and most severe potential impacts. They are not arbitrary but reflect the system's assessment.

## 5. Running "What-If" Scenarios (Conceptual)

The `ScenarioModeler` component (see `semantic_narrative_library/processing/scenario_engine.py`) would allow analysts to explore hypothetical situations.

*   **Defining a Scenario**: An analyst could define a scenario via a JSON structure or a future UI, specifying:
    *   The baseline state (e.g., the current KG).
    *   The hypothetical changes or events to introduce (e.g., "Interest rates increase by 1%," "Competitor X launches disruptive product Y," "New environmental regulation Z is enacted").
*   **Triggering Scenario Analysis**: Via a future UI or an advanced CLI command (like the placeholder `snl-cli run-scenario --scenario-def-path ...`).
*   **Interpreting Scenario Outcomes**: The SNL would:
    1.  Create a temporary "fork" or modified version of the KG reflecting the scenario's assumptions.
    2.  Use the `ImpactAnalyzer` and other relevant processing components to trace the consequences of the scenario's inputs through this modified KG.
    3.  Output would include:
        *   A list of key entities affected and the nature of the impact.
        *   Comparison of key metrics (if applicable) between the baseline and the scenario.
        *   A narrative summarizing the potential unfolding of the scenario and its key implications.

## 6. The Role of Continuous Learning & Analyst Feedback (Conceptual)

A truly advanced SNL would incorporate mechanisms for learning and refinement (as detailed in `semantic_narrative_library/docs/future_enhancements.md` under "Knowledge Graph Evolution").

*   **Analyst-in-the-Loop**:
    *   Analysts could validate or correct system-generated insights (e.g., "This predicted impact did/did not occur," "The sentiment for this news item is actually neutral, not positive").
    *   This feedback would be used to:
        *   Refine the confidence scores of relationships in the KG.
        *   Adjust probabilities or magnitudes in the impact rules.
        *   Improve the training data for underlying ML models (e.g., for sentiment analysis or significance scoring).
    *   **Automated Learning (Conceptual)**: The system could also proactively identify patterns or correlations from new data (e.g., "Event type X in industry Y consistently precedes market signal Z for companies with attribute A"). These system-discovered patterns could be flagged for analyst review and potential incorporation into rules or models.
*   **"Post-Training Fine-Tuning Library"**: The rule sets and models within the SNL would not be static. They would form a "library" that is continuously fine-tuned based on new data, validated outcomes, and analyst feedback, making the system smarter and more accurate over time.

## 7. Bridging Manual Research to Automated Insights

Even with an advanced SNL, manual research (like that described in guide `06_portfolio_news_monitoring_with_google_alerts.md`) remains vital.

*   **Seeding the KG**: Insights, key articles, or identified entities from manual research could be (future feature) ingested into the SNL's KG, enriching its data foundation.
*   **Triggering Automated Analysis**: A piece of news found manually could be the input that an analyst uses to kick off an automated impact analysis workflow within the SNL.
*   **Hypothesis Generation**: The SNL might highlight potential correlations or second-order impacts that an analyst then investigates further using manual deep-dive techniques.

## 8. Conclusion: Augmented Intelligence for the Analyst

The vision for the advanced Semantic Narrative Library is not to replace the analyst but to **augment their capabilities**. By automating data collection, structuring information, performing initial analysis, tracing complex impacts, and modeling scenarios, the SNL would free up analysts to focus on:

*   Higher-level strategic thinking.
*   Validating and interpreting system outputs.
*   Managing exceptions and novel situations not yet covered by the system's rules or models.
*   Communicating insights effectively to stakeholders.

This conceptual guide illustrates the potential of a mature SNL. While the current implementation provides the foundational building blocks, achieving this full vision requires significant further development in NLP, AI/ML, workflow orchestration, and KG technologies. The "Analyst Playbook" itself, by encouraging structured thinking about news and its impacts, helps lay the groundwork for how analysts can best interact with such future systems.
