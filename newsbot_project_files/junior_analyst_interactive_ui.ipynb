    "# Junior Analyst Interactive UI & Insight Generation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome!** This interactive Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you, as a junior analyst, leverage the resources in the `analyst_playbook` to find, generate, and understand key insights about companies, industries, or specific financial topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "*   To guide you through a structured workflow for analysis.\n",
    "*   To show you how to use the LLM prompts in `analyst_playbook/01_llm_prompt_library.json` effectively.\n",
    "*   To help you prepare information and summaries suitable for senior management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use This Notebook:**\n",
    "1.  Read through the Markdown cells for explanations and instructions.\n",
    "2.  Execute the Python code cells (Shift+Enter or click \"Run\"). Many code cells are for demonstration and will help you prepare prompts to be used with an external Large Language Model (LLM) interface (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).\n",
    "3.  Modify the placeholder values in the code cells (e.g., company names, tickers) to suit your specific research task.\n",
    "4.  Refer to the linked documents in the `analyst_playbook` for more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n"

    "## Environment & API Keys (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact directly with Large Language Models (LLMs) from a Python environment (which some advanced cells *could* be adapted to do), you would typically need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Python Libraries:** `openai`, `anthropic`, or other LLM provider libraries.\n",
    "2.  **API Keys:** An API key from your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI Studio).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the primary purpose of this notebook (guiding prompt usage), you do NOT need to execute live LLM calls directly within these cells.** The Python cells below will help you *prepare* prompts. You will then copy these prepared prompts and run them in your usual LLM web interface or dedicated software.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   For more details on advanced AI usage, including prompt engineering, please see `analyst_playbook/04_advanced_ai_usage_guide.md`.\n",
    "*   If you were to extend this notebook for direct API calls, you would manage your API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or a local `.env` file).\n"
