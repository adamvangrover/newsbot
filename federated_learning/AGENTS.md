# Agent Instructions

This directory contains federated learning models. When adding a new model, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Create a new Python file for each model.** The file should be named after the model (e.g., `text_classification_model.py`).
2.  **Implement the model as a function.** The function should take a list of data points as input and return a trained model.
3.  **Add a docstring to the function.** The docstring should explain how the model works and what the input and output are.
4.  **Add a `README.md` file to the directory.** The `README.md` file should explain how to use the new model.
