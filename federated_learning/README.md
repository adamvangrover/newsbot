# Federated Learning

This directory contains models and other code for federated learning. The goal of the federated learning platform is to allow users to collaboratively train a prediction engine without sharing their data.

## Contributing New Models

To contribute a new model, create a new Python file in this directory that implements the model. The file should have a function that takes a list of data points as input and returns a trained model.

## Running the Platform

The federated learning platform is still under development. In the future, you will be able to run the platform by running the `main.py` file in this directory.

## Uploading Terminal Runs

The output of any individual terminal run can be uploaded by users to help train the repo. Please use markdown for downloaded terminal runs.
